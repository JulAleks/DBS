# Vet Clinic Management System

**Welcome to our DBS 211 final project repository!** This project was completed as part of the first year, second semester curriculum.

This project is the culmination of our collaborative efforts in the Introduction to Databases course, which is a part of our first-year curriculum during the second semester. Our project revolves around a business proposal for a veterinary clinic and the development of a comprehensive software solution that streamlines appointment scheduling, patient records, employee management, and medication tracking.

## About

Our project addresses the needs of a veterinary clinic by proposing a database-driven software solution that facilitates efficient clinic management. This system allows for seamless appointment scheduling, maintains comprehensive patient records, manages clinic staff, and ensures accurate medication tracking.

## Features

- **Appointment Management**: Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with ease.
- **Patient Records**: Maintain detailed patient records, including medical history and treatment plans.
- **Employee Management**: Manage clinic staff, their roles, and work schedules.
- **Medication Tracking**: Keep track of medications, prescriptions, and inventory.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate reports for appointments, patient history, and more.

## ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

Our project includes a well-defined Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that outlines the database structure, relationships, and attributes.

## Normalization

We have applied normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy within the database.

## SQL Queries

Explore our SQL queries, which power the functionality of this database management system, facilitating tasks like appointment scheduling, patient record management, and more.
